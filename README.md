# SW-small-dataset
Screw-Washer Dataset for Small Object Detection, the proposed datasets in paper "SO-PERM: Pose Estimation and Robust Measurement for Small Objects" (IJCNN)

This data set contains one hundred pictures of screws and nuts placed in random backgrounds, which are used for small object detection. The images are almost all taken in the lecture hall next to the laboratory, under different scene conditions, and there are targets for participating in other competitions or performing object detection tasks.
